The Open Science Framework
==========================

This repository will soon house the codebase for the Open Science Framework, the open service designed to support scientific workflow and help foster alignment between scientific values and practices.

We're in the last stages of a major rearchitecture and plan to publish the code once we move authentication credentials out of the repo (as of 2013/10/10).

Issue Tracking (Bug Reports)
----------------------------

If you believe you've found a bug in the Framework, please document it using this repository's [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/OpenScienceFramework/issues). We'll work with you to make sure it gets resolved.

Getting Support
---------------

Our primary support mechanism for problems with the OSF is the issue tracking system, above. You can also contact us via email at support@cos.io, or join our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openscienceframework)
