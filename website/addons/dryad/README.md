## Using the Dryad Addon

For the v1 Dryad integration, the addon is ready to go out of the box.

#Using Dryad DOI's

Dryad DOI's come in the form of `doi:10.5061/dryad.XXXX`, where XXXX is the package specific designation. You should receive this number from your publisher, Dryad, or if you wish, you can browse Dryad through the "Search/Browse Dryad" links and Dryad tab.
