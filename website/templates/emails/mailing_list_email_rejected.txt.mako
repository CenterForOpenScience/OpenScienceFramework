The email that you sent to ${target_address} was rejected, and was therefore not forwarded.

%elif reason == mail_log_class.DELETED or reason == mail_log_class.NOT_FOUND or reason == mail_log_class.FORBIDDEN:
The reason for this rejection was either that there is no project/component associated with the mailing list email that you sent to, or that you are not a contributor to the project/component associated with it.

%elif reason == mail_log_class.DISABLED:
The reason for this rejection was that your ${node_type} at ${node_url} does not have its mailing list currently enabled. Please ${'go to {}settings/#configureMailingListAnchor to enable this mailing list.'.format(node_url) if is_admin else 'ask an administrator on your {} to enable this mailing list.'.format(node_type)}
