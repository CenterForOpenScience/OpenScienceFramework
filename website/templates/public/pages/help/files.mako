    <h4 class="m-t-lg f-w-lg">Files</h4>
    <p>Each project and component can have its own set of files. This allows you to organize your files into meaningful
        groups like datasets or background research. Each file is given a unique URL, meaning that it can be cited or
        linked to individually.</p>
    <p>To upload a file, drag the file from your desktop onto the file tree, or, from the Files tab,
        select a storage add-on and click the upload button. </p>
    <p id="version-control">OSF Storage, the default storage add-on for every project, supports version control.
        You can create new versions of a file by re-uploading the latest copy&mdash;no need to change the name. 
        To view or download old versions, click on the "Revisions" button on the top right
        of the page when viewing the file.</p>
    <p>To download a file, select the file and click the "Download" button that appears in the toolbar. To delete a file, 
        select the file and click the Delete button. You can create folders by selecting the appropriate
        storage add-on and clicking the "Create Folder" button in the toolbar.</p>
    <p>Only contributors of that component with writing privileges can add or delete a file. If a component is set to
        be private, then no one will be able to see the enclosed files, but public components and projects allow
        anyone to download their materials.</p>
    <p id="md5">OSF Storage provides hashes for each file version. To see a file's MD5 and SHA1 hashes, click "revisions"
    on the file's page.</p>
