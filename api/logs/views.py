    Paginated list of nodes that the user contributes to.  Each resource contains the full representation of the node,

    + `page=<Int>` -- page number of results to view, default 1

    + `filter[<fieldname>]=<Str>` -- fields and values to filter the search results on.

    <!--- Copied Query Params from NodeList -->

    Nodes may be filtered by their `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `registration`, or `tags`.  `title`,
    `description`, and `category` are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching.  `public` and
    `registration` are booleans, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as `true`, `false`, `0`, or `1`.  Note
    that quoting `true` or `false` in the query will cause the match to fail regardless.  `tags` is an array of simple strings.
